# WeatherApp
 It's a weather app created with node.js and express.js using REST


How does it work? 

this project has one entry: the city name. then it goes through the first function that works to find lat,lon of the entered location using openWeather API, then it returns those info into the second API that finds the weather info using lat,lon. I created this connection with the third API
